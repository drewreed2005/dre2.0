## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

The grind continues! Team organization is good but could use more focus. I want to see my members utilizing the Scrum Board more.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

We'll deal with JWT on the established frontend later, as it works with Postman (sometimes?). ClassPeriod functionality is very nearly finished, and it'll mostly take displaying.
- Finish ClassPeriod
- Start connections to Person and Assignment
- ClassPeriod displays on frontend?

Night at the Museum fast approaches! We really need a good way to display data on the frontend.
