## Planning for This Week

### New Blog Fixes

Tags aren't quite working properly and I'm getting build errors! Time to troubleshoot:
- Java 2D array read as liquid by Jekyll?
- Tags not working for anything other than tangible

### Contents of the Week

For PBL:
- Finishing touches on styling
- Convert current content on color sorting game so that Haseeb can finish
- Update Scrum Board with big tangible ticket

For lessons:
- Java Exploits and Cybersecurity work
    - Focus on PicoCTF for now, since that seems like a huge task
- JWT work

Hopefully working with the JWT lesson will help us discover the problem with our own JWT sending errors.
