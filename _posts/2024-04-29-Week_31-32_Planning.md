## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

This is the beginning of the lead-up to the AP test, so there may be review involved, but I will likely save that for week 33-34, as I'm confident in my ability to succeed without so much studying. I want to focus more on PBL to get Assignment to a fully working state and ship.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

Assignment submission has been properly modified to accomodate all of its proper attributes, but connections are still finnicky and the frontend needs to be redesigned. I will request that to be done while functionality is restored. Raymond is making steady progress toward file upload after making that focus shift.
