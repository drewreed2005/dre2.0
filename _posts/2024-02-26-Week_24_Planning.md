## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

This week is finishing up, so I want to get all finished reviewing early. All FRQs have been finished over break.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

Mostly, I just want to compile my contributions to the project. That will be Monday's primary focus now that the expectations for such a blog have been more clearly outlined.

#### FRQs

As I mentioned, all FRQs were finished over break, with very solid reflections. I'll be peer grading as soon as possible. I know I deserve strong scores.

I have other finals that I'm less prepared for, so I want to make sure to give myself time for them by using my Period 1 time wisely.

I may also need to help AJ with FRQ peer grades if he stays behind.
