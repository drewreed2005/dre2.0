## Planning for This Week

### New Blog

This is my new blog! Hopefully I can get to styling it soon (maybe over break), but for now, the priority is...
- Starting with weekly planning
- Blogging my lesson contributions
- Fixing blog organization

#### New Tags

I've looked through the liquid of schedule.html and created these new tags:
- "plan" for planning (like this blog)
- "code" for a code blog
- "tangible" for a tangible blog

### Contents of the Week

For PBL:
- Fix timing with BigSort (if possible)
- Support AJ/Haseeb on finishing fibonacci methods (backend)

For lessons:
- Finishing touches on our SQL lesson
- Begin grading when possible

The lessons content will have the highest priority for now.
