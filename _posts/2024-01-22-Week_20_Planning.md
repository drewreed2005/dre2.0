## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

Group work is going great, especially thanks to weekly lunch meetings. Aiden is great with wireframes, which has made frontend work great.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

Roles are all implemented, but API methods and ClassPeriod need to be dealt with. The main focus here is:
- Sign-in method
    - Corresponding frontend
- Create, delete, and update methods
- ClassPeriod (if possible)

#### Lesson

Right now, we'll be focusing on incorporating the contents of the previous three lessons (see blog timebox) into our project.
