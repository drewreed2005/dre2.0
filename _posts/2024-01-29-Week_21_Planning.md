## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

The grind continues! Team organization is good but could use more focus. I want to see my members utilizing the Scrum Board more.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

User methods are working properly aside from sign-in. We'll start with these priorities:
- ClassPeriod
- Get JWT to send to Postman for Person sign-in

#### Lesson

Right now, we'll be focusing on incorporating the contents of the previous three lessons (see blog timebox) into our project.
