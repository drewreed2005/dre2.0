## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

The team must be rebuilt stronger than ever if we want to finish Nighthawk Resources strong!

#### PBL Week Run-Down

I have lots of good feedback from N@tM to remember, so I want to make sure to go back and reread the notes going into this coming week. It may help me make informed selections for groups or triangles to merge with.

Otherwise, we'll see how the new trimester begins to shake out.
