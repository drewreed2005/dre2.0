## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

It seems that we'll be adopting separated previous team members Ryan and Edwin, plus Aaron, Isabelle, and Kevin (all from our period). I'm planning to lead the charge with the triangle of AJ, Raymond and Haoxuan. Haoxuan has also been added to our group.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

We may turn our attention to fixing the ClassPeriod errors that existed in the previous trimester, but we will also be integrating the other new members' features into our site, so those will need to be planned. We'll make new spaces for them on the Scrum Board.

Speaking of which: they need access to all resources! We are getting on that A$AP Rocky.
