## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

Night at the Museum is this week! With divided attention because of the musical, I'll need to really lock in to finish up the Dashboard functionality. It's okay if it ends up with debug features in display.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

Finish Dashboard! That's my main priority.

I need my team members to also finish up:
- Assignment creation on the frontend
- JWT send with sign-in (since that's now Ekam's problem)
- Image recognition easily displayable
- QR code working (currently shouldn't be a problem)
