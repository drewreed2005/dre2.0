### Code Qualifications

Throughout my projects in AP Computer Sciences, I have grown proficient with a variety of frameworks, languages, and libraries. Below, I go over some that I believe are relevant to this internship.

#### Python & Flask

Throughout my time in AP Computer Science Principles, I was largely backend-focused and became very comfortable working with Python and the Flask framework.

#### SQL

All large-scale projects taken on throughout my time in AP Computer Science courses have been founded largely in SQL database management.

I have acted as a Scrum Master in 5 of my 6 PBL projects taken over the course of the year.
