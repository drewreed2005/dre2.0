## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

There is some individual focus during these weeks on sort implementation with custom collection and collectable classes. Keeping that in mind, less time will be afforded to project development, but week 27-28 goals of full assignment implementation continue their relevance.

#### PBL Week Run-Down

An AssignmentSubmission class has been created and successfully (partially) implemented to represent assignment submissions, but file uploads are currently tricky to get right. Raymond is focusing on that feature while I continue to develop the assignment API methods and details.
