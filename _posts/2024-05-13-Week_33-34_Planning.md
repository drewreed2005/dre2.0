## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

AP test week! Week 1 will be focused on studying, with as much time as possible devoted to PBL. Main PBL contributions will resume following testing.

(EDIT: Plans changed in second week due to the introduction of the calculator enactment assignment. AssignmentSubmission was finished aside from API methods, but not as much overall triangle process happened.)

#### PBL Week Run-Down

Assignment submission is nearly complete in terms of its attributes and interactions, but I would like to get the API methods done as soon as possible so that a new wireframe (in the works, this week, by me?) can have time to be realized. My SASS and general styling work is a bit rusty.
