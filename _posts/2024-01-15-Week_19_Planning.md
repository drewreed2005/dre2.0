## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

New cross-period group formed!

#### PBL Week Run-Down

We're making Nighthawk Resources, which essentially combines:
- Canvas
- Stapplet

This week's focus will be on:
- Implementing Person roles with new attribute(s)
- Parallels with new less, see below

#### New Lesson

Our lesson is on roles, which already needs to be implemented in our project. Once I understand them through working with Ekam on them in our personal project, we'll be able to make a really strong section in our lesson.

We're already mostly done, but there's still this to do:
- Implement with security configurations
- Fix role initialization
