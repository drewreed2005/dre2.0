## Planning for This Week

### Contents of the Week

We will have Ryan, Edwin and Aiden focus on creating the ArrayList lesson, while Toby and I study up on it to present it to the class. If something gets in the way, we have two people who can handle it. (Something did get in the way, ha ha CAASPP testing)

#### PBL Week Run-Down

We have already begun progress toward fixing the structure of the ClassPeriod class in relation to Assignment. It looks like, in the coming weeks, we'll make backend connections that allow for full Assignment integration: grading, viewing, etc. We aren't sure how we'll do viewing yet, but Raymond is working on an issue.
