    "## Question 1: 2D Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves reasoning about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of integers. You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Write a static method arraySum that calculates and returns the sum of the entries in a specified one-dimensional array. The following example shows an array arr1 and the value returned by a call to arraySum.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Write a static method rowSums that calculates the sums of each of the rows in a given two-dimensional array and returns these sums in a one-dimensional array. The method has one parameter, a two-dimensional array arr2D of int values. The array is in row-major order: arr2D [r] [c] is the entry at row r and column c. The method returns a one-dimensional array with one entry for each row of arr2D such that each entry is the sum of the corresponding row in arr2D. As a reminder, each row of a two-dimensional array is a one-dimensional array. Assume that arraySum works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a). You must use arraySum appropriately to receive full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. A two-dimensional array is diverse if no two of its rows have entries that sum to the same value. In the following examples, the array mat1 is diverse because each row sum is different, but the array mat2 is not diverse because the first and last rows have the same sum. Write a static method isDiverse that determines whether or not a given two-dimensional array is diverse. The method has one parameter: a two-dimensional array arr2D of int values. The method should return true if all the row sums in the given array are unique; otherwise, it should return false. In the arrays shown above, the call isDiverse (mat1) returns true and the call isDiverse(mat2) returns false. Assume that arraySum and rowSums work as specified, regardless of what you wrote in parts (a) and(b). You must use rowSums appropriately to receive full credit.\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to go part-by-part below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a matter of basic iteration, so simple there wasn't much struggle to speak of. I initialized an integer variable at 0 to make the sum of the elements, used a simple for-each loop to iterate through the array elements and add them to the sum, and then returned the sum. I've done this a bunch of times before with a one-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was another very simple one, but there was one minor point of concern: I am not very used to initializing an array, as most of the Java programming I've done in the past year has worked primarily with ArrayLists. However, I thought I remembered being able to initialize an array of a given length with the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] output = new int[arr2D.length];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other possible point of confusion was figuring out how many rows were in a 2D array, but I was pretty confident that, since a 2D array can be visualized as an array full of rows (if you ignore verticality), I was fairly certain that `arr2D.length` would represent the number of rows. That also happens to be the number of sums needed to be stored in these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each sum corresponds to a certain row of the 2D array argument, I was able to use the same incrementing `i` variable from the for loop to refer to both the place for the sum in the array and the row referred to in the `arraySum` call. I thought this was pretty smart and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < arr2D.length; i++) {\n",
    "    output[i] = arraySum(arr2D[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (c)\n",
    "\n",
    "I've seen lots of different ways to look for duplicates in Java, but since the problem only specifies that the code from the Java Quick Reference is valid (which I kept open during the FRQ process), I couldn't just use the much easier `contains` method (see the end of this reflection for implementation). As a result, I used a more standard method of iterating through each value and checking if the previous values in the array are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < arr2DSums.length; i++) {\n",
    "    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) { // checking if the current element is equal to any previous element\n",
    "        if (arr2DSums[i] == arr2DSums[j]) {\n",
    "            return false; // false if a dupe is found\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I was trying to be very thoughtful about efficiency in this problem, which partially made me worried about nesting iteration through the sum array in the code above. I did, however, intentionally define the array of sums at the top of the method instead of repeatedly calling the method to calculate them. This might have been an obvious choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] arr2DSums = rowSums(arr2D);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish I could have used `contains` for this problem; it would have made it a lot simpler. I also could have used a `HashSet` to store sums because they can't include duplicates, but I wasn't sure if College Board allows for things like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had the opportunity, I would simplify the method to be written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static boolean isDiverse(int[][] arr2D) {\n",
    "\tint[] arr2DSums = rowSums(arr2D);\n",
    "\tSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); // because sets cannot have duplicate values\n",
    "\tfor (int sum : arr2DSums) {\n",
    "\t\tif (set.contains(sum)) {\n",
    "\t\t\treturn false; // false if there are duplicate sums\n",
    "\t\t} else {\n",
    "\t\t\tset.add(sum);\n",
    "\t\t}\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\treturn true; // true if no duplicates are found\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Notes and Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `.length` of a 2D array represents the number of rows it contains, assuming it is formatted in the typical [r][c] fashion.\n",
    "- If corresponding indexes between multiple arrays are being accessed in the same iterative process, it may be a good idea to use a standard iterating variable for loop to iterate so that it can be applied to all relevant arrays.\n",
    "- When initializing an array, the statement is formatted as follows: `type[] varName = new type[arrayLength]`\n",
    "- When an integer array is initialized to a certain length, each of those elements will be 0 initially, so they can be incremented immediately from 0.\n",
    "- A HashSet is best used in a situation where a collection of elements must not contain duplicates and its order doesn't matter. A LinkedHashSet preserves order, however, and thus may be preferable in some cases."

    "\n",
    "There wasn't much complexity to this problem aside from the limitations that prevented me from using the \"char\" class with only the provided String object methods from the Java Quick Reference, which forced me to use `.substring` throughout instead. I could be wrong, but since none of the specifically provided String object methods allow for conversion to an array of characters, which is how I've previously iterated through Strings like this, I don't think College Board intends for the char primitive to be derived from a String. In the code below, I prevent unnecessary calls to substring by defining the relevant substring of the guess once and referring to the variable throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String thisLetter = guess.substring(i, i + 1);\n",
    "if (this.word.indexOf(thisLetter) > -1) {\n",
    "    if (this.word.substring(i, i + 1).equals(thisLetter)) {\n",
    "        output += thisLetter; // letter found in the proper place\n",
    "    } else { // etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By referencing the Java Quick Reference guide, I was able to find the method `.indexOf` (shown above) for String that I hadn't ever used before. Using this method allowed me to check if a certain character was contained in the word at all before checking if it was in the proper place, with a larger else statement connected that added a \"*\" if it wasn't contained in the word. This made it more convenient to use `.substring`, too, as the `.indexOf` method allowed by the Java Quick Reference takes a String argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from that, there wasn't much complexity to speak of in this problem aside from in my larger, fully-functional rendition of the game in the block above. I'm not sure if we're allowed to use Scanner in College Board responses, but that added complexity to the overall interactions with the `getHint` method. I also added an error handler for invalid word length below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (guess.length() != this.word.length()) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Invalid guess. Your guess must be \" + this.word.length() + \" characters long.\");\n",
    "    return null; // returning for invalid guess\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to return `null` instead of a String here to ensure that no logic is performed on an invalid guess, and there's even a conditional check if the input was valid in the custom game method I made. Some other error prevention came in the form of using `.toUpperCase` on all word inputs, which the question just asks to be implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Notes and Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Java Quick Reference provided by College Board provides many potentially useful methods that save some time.\n",
    "- `null` can be output in place of the expected type of output for a method, but ensure that any logic performed on the output of that method accounts for the possibility of returning `null`.\n",
    "- If a String is not initialized with a value, unlike how it works with creating an array of integers, for example, the String will be a `null` until specified otherwise.\n",
    "- There weren't many takeaways from this CB problem overall, but in general, it's important to ensure that all class methods speak to each other as intended."

    "\n",
    "### Question Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-dimensional array of integers in which most elements are zero is called a sparse array. Because most elements have a value of zero, memory can be saved by storing only the non-zero values along with their row and column indexes. The following complete SparseArrayEntry class is used to represent non-zero elements in a sparse array. A SparseArrayEntry object cannot be modified after it has been constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SparseArray class represents a sparse array. It contains a list of SparseArrayEntry objects, each of which represents one of the non-zero elements in the array. The entries representing the non-zero elements are stored in the list in no particular order. Each non-zero element is represented by exactly one entry in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write the SparseArray method getValueAt. The method returns the value of the sparse array element at a given row and column in the sparse array. If the list entries contains an entry with the specified row and column, the value associated with the entry is returned. If there is no entry in entries corresponding to the specified row and column, 0 is returned.\n",
    "In the example above, the call sparse.getValueAt(3, 1) would return -9, and sparse.getValueAt(3, 3) would return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Write the SparseArray method removeColumn. After removing a specified column from a sparsearray:\n",
    "- All entries in the list entries with column indexes matching col are removed from the list.\n",
    "- All entries in the list entries with column indexes greater than col are replaced by entries with column indexes that are decremented by one (moved one column to the left).\n",
    "- The number of columns in the sparse array is adjusted to reflect the column removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below contains the SparseArrayEntry class, which hasn't been modified, but must be included for the following code, the SparseArray class, which has been visibly modified, to fully function."

    "\n",
    "I hadn't ever used a fully unique, customized interface before doing this question, but I was able to figure out how interfaces work through my time working with the JPA repository interfaces of our SpringPortfolio projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, I knew that, for part (a), I just needed to define the interface with the proper name containing one method with the right integer parameter, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface NumberGroup {\n",
    "    boolean contains (int val);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, interfaces are essentially blueprints for a more involved instance to base its functionality off of, which are seen in the following two parts of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My only potential confusion in part (b) was whether or not I needed to specify that a parent (interface) method was being \"overwritten\" if I defined it as intended in the `Range` class, but remembering JPA repository, I assumed not and was correct. Aside from that, I had to fight my urge to represent the comparison between the minimum, target value, and end like I would mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "this.min <= val <= this.max\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would create an error, as the comparisons must be separate. Once again, I ended up using the `&&` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "this.min <= val && val <= this.max\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to use interfaces at this point, part (c) was extremely easy. The prompt outlines exactly what to include in the class (`groupList` collection attribute, initialized in constructor, with `contains` method that checks for containment in all associated number groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having worked with Many-to-Many collections in our projects throughout the year, I knew to simply initialize the `groupList` as an empty ArrayList and leave adding items to that ArrayList to another method (not required by the question, but needed for testing). I could have made it so that the list and its contents were added as an argument to the constructor, but it made more sense to start it as empty and allow the user to add to the list separately. This is the most common practice for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// no argument constructor\n",
    "public MultipleGroups() {\n",
    "    this.groupList = new ArrayList<NumberGroup>();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from that, I was able to decrease the amount of code by efficiently using the `NumberGroup` `contains` method that must be present in all entries of the `groupList` when iterating through at checking. Doing so also allows for multiple different types of groups to be stored AND examined within the `MultipleGroups` class, as all must have their own `contians` method as a result of the interface outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (NumberGroup group : groupList) {\n",
    "    if (group.contains(val)) {\n",
    "        return true;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "return false;\n",

    "#### Overall Notes and Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interfaces essentially act as outlines or blueprints for the functionality of a class or set of classes, especially those that can work together.\n",
    "- In these College Board FRQ especially but also in general, it's important to use other methods that have already been created to make an class's functionality more efficient.\n",
    "- If an ArrayList or some sort of list attribute is part of an object's primary functionality, it should most likely be initialized in the constructor, argument or no-argument.\n",
    "    - It is most useful to have an addition method to add to it rather than one that entirely overwrites the attribute's ArrayList.\n",
    "- Multiple numerical comparisons cannot be done with the same set of operators."
