    "## Question 1: [SAY QUESTION TYPE]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves reasoning about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of integers. You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Write a static method arraySum that calculates and returns the sum of the entries in a specified one-dimensional array. The following example shows an array arr1 and the value returned by a call to arraySum.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Write a static method rowSums that calculates the sums of each of the rows in a given two-dimensional array and returns these sums in a one-dimensional array. The method has one parameter, a two-dimensional array arr2D of int values. The array is in row-major order: arr2D [r] [c] is the entry at row r and column c. The method returns a one-dimensional array with one entry for each row of arr2D such that each entry is the sum of the corresponding row in arr2D. As a reminder, each row of a two-dimensional array is a one-dimensional array. Assume that arraySum works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a). You must use arraySum appropriately to receive full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. A two-dimensional array is diverse if no two of its rows have entries that sum to the same value. In the following examples, the array mat1 is diverse because each row sum is different, but the array mat2 is not diverse because the first and last rows have the same sum. Write a static method isDiverse that determines whether or not a given two-dimensional array is diverse. The method has one parameter: a two-dimensional array arr2D of int values. The method should return true if all the row sums in the given array are unique; otherwise, it should return false. In the arrays shown above, the call isDiverse (mat1) returns true and the call isDiverse(mat2) returns false. Assume that arraySum and rowSums work as specified, regardless of what you wrote in parts (a) and(b). You must use rowSums appropriately to receive full credit.\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to go part-by-part below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (a)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a matter of basic iteration, so simple there wasn't much struggle to speak of. I initialized an integer variable at 0 to make the sum of the elements, used a simple for-each loop to iterate through the array elements and add them to the sum, and then returned the sum. I've done this a bunch of times before with a one-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was another very simple one, but there was one minor point of concern: I am not very used to initializing an array, as most of the Java programming I've done in the past year has worked primarily with ArrayLists. However, I thought I remembered being able to initialize an array of a given length with the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] output = new int[arr2D.length];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other possible point of confusion was figuring out how many rows were in a 2D array, but I was pretty confident that, since a 2D array can be visualized as an array full of rows (if you ignore verticality), I was fairly certain that `arr2D.length` would represent the number of rows. That also happens to be the number of sums needed to be stored in these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each sum corresponds to a certain row of the 2D array argument, I was able to use the same incrementing `i` variable from the for loop to refer to both the place for the sum in the array and the row referred to in the `arraySum` call. I thought this was pretty smart and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < arr2D.length; i++) {\n",
    "    output[i] = arraySum(arr2D[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part (c)\n",
    "\n",
    "I've seen lots of different ways to look for duplicates in Java, but since the problem only specifies that the code from the Java Quick Reference is valid (which I kept open during the FRQ process), I couldn't just use the much easier `contains` method (see the end of this reflection for implementation). As a result, I used a more standard method of iterating through each value and checking if the previous values in the array are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < arr2DSums.length; i++) {\n",
    "    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) { // checking if the current element is equal to any previous element\n",
    "        if (arr2DSums[i] == arr2DSums[j]) {\n",
    "            return false; // false if a dupe is found\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I was trying to be very thoughtful about efficiency in this problem, which partially made me worried about nesting iteration through the sum array in the code above. I did, however, intentionally define the array of sums at the top of the method instead of repeatedly calling the method to calculate them. This might have been an obvious choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] arr2DSums = rowSums(arr2D);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish I could have used `contains` for this problem; it would have made it a lot simpler. I also could have used a `HashSet` to store sums because they can't include duplicates, but I wasn't sure if College Board allows for things like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had the opportunity, I would simplify the method to be written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static boolean isDiverse(int[][] arr2D) {\n",
    "\tint[] arr2DSums = rowSums(arr2D);\n",
    "\tSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); // because sets cannot have duplicate values\n",
    "\tfor (int sum : arr2DSums) {\n",
    "\t\tif (set.contains(sum)) {\n",
    "\t\t\treturn false; // false if there are duplicate sums\n",
    "\t\t} else {\n",
    "\t\t\tset.add(sum);\n",
    "\t\t}\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\treturn true; // true if no duplicates are found\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Notes and Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `.length` of a 2D array represents the number of rows it contains, assuming it is formatted in the typical [r][c] fashion.\n",
    "- If corresponding indexes between multiple arrays are being accessed in the same iterative process, it may be a good idea to use a standard iterating variable for loop to iterate so that it can be applied to all relevant arrays.\n",
    "- When initializing an array, the statement is formatted as follows: `type[] varName = new type[arrayLength]`\n",
    "- When an integer array is initialized to a certain length, each of those elements will be 0 initially, so they can be incremented immediately from 0.\n",
    "- A HashSet is best used in a situation where a collection of elements must not contain duplicates and its order doesn't matter. A LinkedHashSet preserves order, however, and thus may be preferable in some cases."

    "\n",
    "There wasn't much complexity to this problem aside from the limitations that prevented me from using the \"char\" class with only the provided String object methods from the Java Quick Reference, which forced me to use `.substring` throughout instead. I could be wrong, but since none of the specifically provided String object methods allow for conversion to an array of characters, which is how I've previously iterated through Strings like this, I don't think College Board intends for the char primitive to be derived from a String. In the code below, I prevent unnecessary calls to substring by defining the relevant substring of the guess once and referring to the variable throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String thisLetter = guess.substring(i, i + 1);\n",
    "if (this.word.indexOf(thisLetter) > -1) {\n",
    "    if (this.word.substring(i, i + 1).equals(thisLetter)) {\n",
    "        output += thisLetter; // letter found in the proper place\n",
    "    } else { // etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By referencing the Java Quick Reference guide, I was able to find the method `.indexOf` (shown above) for String that I hadn't ever used before. Using this method allowed me to check if a certain character was contained in the word at all before checking if it was in the proper place, with a larger else statement connected that added a \"*\" if it wasn't contained in the word. This made it more convenient to use `.substring`, too, as the `.indexOf` method allowed by the Java Quick Reference takes a String argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from that, there wasn't much complexity to speak of in this problem aside from in my larger, fully-functional rendition of the game in the block above. I'm not sure if we're allowed to use Scanner in College Board responses, but that added complexity to the overall interactions with the `getHint` method. I also added an error handler for invalid word length below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (guess.length() != this.word.length()) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Invalid guess. Your guess must be \" + this.word.length() + \" characters long.\");\n",
    "    return null; // returning for invalid guess\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to return `null` instead of a String here to ensure that no logic is performed on an invalid guess, and there's even a conditional check if the input was valid in the custom game method I made. Some other error prevention came in the form of using `.toUpperCase` on all word inputs, which the question just asks to be implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Notes and Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Java Quick Reference provided by College Board provides many potentially useful methods that save some time.\n",
    "- `null` can be output in place of the expected type of output for a method, but ensure that any logic performed on the output of that method accounts for the possibility of returning `null`.\n",
    "- If a String is not initialized with a value, unlike how it works with creating an array of integers, for example, the String will be a `null` until specified otherwise.\n",
    "- There weren't many takeaways from this CB problem overall, but in general, it's important to ensure that all class methods speak to each other as intended."
