    "\n",
    "1. **Class Header**:\n",
    "   - `public class Textbook extends Book`: Declares the class header.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Variable**:\n",
    "    - `private int edition`: This variable stores the edition number of the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constructor**:\n",
    "    - `public Textbook(String t, double p, int e)`: This is the constructor method for the `Textbook` class. It takes three parameters: a `String` for the title (`t`), a `double` for the price (`p`), and an `int` for the edition (`e`)\n",
    "    - It initializes the instance variables of the `Textbook` class using the `super` keyword to call the constructor of the superclass `Book`, passing the title and price\n",
    "    - Then, it sets the `edition` instance variable to the value provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Accessor Method**:\n",
    "    - `public int getEdition()`: This method returns the edition number of the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Other Methods**:\n",
    "    - `public String getBookInfo()`: This method returns a string containing information about the textbook\n",
    "    - It calls the `getBookInfo()` method of the superclass `Book` to get the title and price, and then appends the edition number to it.\n",
    "    - `public boolean canSubstituteFor(Textbook other)`: This method checks if the current textbook can substitute another textbook (`other`)\n",
    "      - It returns `true` if the titles are equal and if the edition of the current textbook is greater than or equal to the edition of the other textbook.\n",

    "### Inheritance (Unit 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a program to manage a zoo, where various types of animals are kept in different enclosures. To streamline your code, you decide to use inheritance to model the relationships between different types of animals and their behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Explain the concept of inheritance in Java. Provide an example scenario where inheritance is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Inheritence allows POJOs to be able to use attributes and methods from other classes that act as parents to them. This can also allow a more specific instance of a broader class to be used (in the examples above, a Textbook being a more specific type of Book (parent class)). Inheritence is implemented by declaring a class a subclass of another class (the parent class), which will allow the class to utilize attributes, methods, and (using super()) constructors of the parent.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Inheritance can be useful, for example, if creating a subset of a broader object type that must handle a greater number of variables/attributes and/or must handle parent variables/attributes in a way that is different from the parent. If a Sandwich class, for example, was being used, a Hamburger subclass may be helpful if we wanted more specific data about the hamburger. It might have a meatWeight attribute or a cookType (medium, well, etc.) attribute that a sandwich would not need/have. However, by extending Sandwich, the hamburger class could utilize the attribtes like the contents of the Sandwich that apply to the burger, too.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a Java class hierarchy to represent different types of animals in the zoo. Create a superclass `Animal` with basic attributes and methods common to all animals, and at least three subclasses representing specific types of animals with additional attributes and methods. Include comments to explain your code, specifically how inheritance is used."
