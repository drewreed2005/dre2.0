    "\n",
    "Consider a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. The hidden word contains only capital letters and has a length known to the player. A guess contains only capital letters and has the same length as the hidden word.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HiddenWord class will be used to represent the hidden word in the game. The hidden word is passed to the constructor. The class contains a method, getHint, that takes a guess and produces a hint.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the variable puzzle is declared as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "HiddenWord puzzle = new HiddenWord(\"HARPS\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the complete HiddenWord class, including any necessary instance variables, its constructor, and the method, getHint, described above. You may assume that the length of the guess is the same as the length of the hidden word.\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "There wasn't much complexity to this problem aside from the limitations that prevented me from using the \"char\" class with only the provided String object methods from the Java Quick Reference, which forced me to use `.substring` throughout instead. I could be wrong, but since none of the specifically provided String object methods allow for conversion to an array of characters, which is how I've previously iterated through Strings like this, I don't think College Board intends for the char primitive to be derived from a String. In the code below, I prevent unnecessary calls to substring by defining the relevant substring of the guess once and referring to the variable throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String thisLetter = guess.substring(i, i + 1);\n",
    "if (this.word.indexOf(thisLetter) > -1) {\n",
    "    if (this.word.substring(i, i + 1).equals(thisLetter)) {\n",
    "        output += thisLetter; // letter found in the proper place\n",
    "    } else { // etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By referencing the Java Quick Reference guide, I was able to find the method `.indexOf` (shown above) for String that I hadn't ever used before. Using this method allowed me to check if a certain character was contained in the word at all before checking if it was in the proper place, with a larger else statement connected that added a \"*\" if it wasn't contained in the word. This made it more convenient to use `.substring`, too, as the `.indexOf` method allowed by the Java Quick Reference takes a String argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from that, there wasn't much complexity to speak of in this problem aside from in my larger, fully-functional rendition of the game in the block above. I'm not sure if we're allowed to use Scanner in College Board responses, but that added complexity to the overall interactions with the `getHint` method. I also added an error handler for invalid word length below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (guess.length() != this.word.length()) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Invalid guess. Your guess must be \" + this.word.length() + \" characters long.\");\n",
    "    return null; // returning for invalid guess\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to return `null` instead of a String here to ensure that no logic is performed on an invalid guess, and there's even a conditional check if the input was valid in the custom game method I made. Some other error prevention came in the form of using `.toUpperCase` on all word inputs, which the question just asks to be implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Notes and Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Java Quick Reference provided by College Board provides many potentially useful methods that save some time.\n",
    "- `null` can be output in place of the expected type of output for a method, but ensure that any logic performed on the output of that method accounts for the possibility of returning `null`.\n",
    "- If a String is not initialized with a value, unlike how it works with creating an array of integers, for example, the String will be a `null` until specified otherwise.\n",
    "- There weren't many takeaways from this CB problem overall, but in general, it's important to ensure that all class methods speak to each other as intended."
