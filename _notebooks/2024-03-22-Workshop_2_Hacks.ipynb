    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Private access means that a variable or method can only be directly accessed within the object's own data and methods, NOT by directly calling them outside of it. Private variables can't even be accessed by subclasses. For example, if an object Book has a private String author, you could NOT access an instance's book.author directly; you'd have to access through a getter like book.getAuthor().</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Public access means that a variable or method can be accessed from any other class. This can be used for easier implementation if the integrity of the object's data is not of great importance, for example. It may lead to reduced encapsulation if used incorrectly.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Using private access in a POJO ensures that its internal state is only accessible and modifiable by methods defined within the same class, which helps maintain data integrity and encapsulation principles. The scope of a class, variable or method in the context of a POJO primarily affects the ability of other classes to interact with it. Using private can help to control the manipulation of data by ensuring that it only occurs within the specific conditions of the object.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>One example is a pretty common one: a BankAccount class vs. a Bank class. A BankAccount object would have a lot of important info that should not be modifiable outside of the specifications of the BankAccount class, ensuring that the data is safe.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n"
