    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Private access means that a variable or method can only be directly accessed within the object's own data and methods, NOT by directly calling them outside of it. Private variables can't even be accessed by subclasses. For example, if an object Book has a private String author, you could NOT access an instance's book.author directly; you'd have to access through a getter like book.getAuthor().</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Public access means that a variable or method can be accessed from any other class. This can be used for easier implementation if the integrity of the object's data is not of great importance, for example. It may lead to reduced encapsulation if used incorrectly.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Using private access in a POJO ensures that its internal state is only accessible and modifiable by methods defined within the same class, which helps maintain data integrity and encapsulation principles. The scope of a class, variable or method in the context of a POJO primarily affects the ability of other classes to interact with it. Using private can help to control the manipulation of data by ensuring that it only occurs within the specific conditions of the object.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>One example is a pretty common one: a BankAccount class vs. a Bank class. A BankAccount object would have a lot of important info that should not be modifiable outside of the specifications of the BankAccount class, ensuring that the data is safe and accessed in limited ways. However, since we do want people to be able to access their bank accounts within limited capacity, the class Bank would contain public methods to interact with BankAccounts, particularly given proper credentials and valid arguments.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects"

    "\n",
    "(a) Describe the different features needed to create a class and what their purpose is.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Classes technically only need to be declared with a unique name (preferably capitalized and camel-case) to be \"created,\" but there are many components to classes. For a class to be the kind that College Board has us writing usually (like a POJO), it will often need attributes (class instance variables), constructors (which can include both argument constructors that use arguments to assign attributes AND non-argument constructors that set attributes to defaults), and/or unique class methods (which interact with the object/instance).</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Classes are used as blueprints/instructions for the creation of object instances. This allows multiple different objects of the same class to be created, but to be interacted with in similar ways. For example, if a class for Person exists in a health database/program, it will likely contain info like the person's name, height, weight, age, etc. Even though multiple different instances of that person will have different values for their attributes, the same class methods can be used to access, modify, and utilize those values.</mark>\n",

This can also allow a more specific instance of a broader class to be used (in the examples above, a Textbook being a more specific type of Book (parent class)). Inheritence is implemented by declaring a class a subclass of another class (the parent class), which will allow the class to utilize attributes, methods, and (using super()) constructors of the parent.</mark>\n",

    "<mark>Inheritance can be useful, for example, if creating a subset of a broader object type that must handle a greater number of variables/attributes and/or must handle parent variables/attributes in a way that is different from the parent. If a Sandwich class, for example, was being used, a Hamburger subclass may be helpful if we wanted more specific data about the hamburger. It might have a meatWeight attribute or a cookType (medium, well, etc.) attribute that a sandwich would not need/have. However, by extending Sandwich, the hamburger class could utilize the attribtes like the contents of the Sandwich that apply to the burger, too.</mark>\n",
