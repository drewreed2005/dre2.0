    "\n",
    "Means of traversing and interacting with 2D arrays are relatively specific in the context of one College Board problem (i.e., iterate through to determine a condition about a row, find a value in a row, search columns by condition, etc.), so make sure to analyze the context to determine if a certain method may be used again to abstract what would otherwise be a more complex task in a future method. With practice, this connection should be obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no possible relevance between two methods, this may not necessarily be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you use the proper parameters when calling your own method! Scoring guidelines are sometimes lenient about this, but don’t tempt fate. Just format your call properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a “helper” method is provided to you in a question, *make sure to note it and use it*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one is provided, it is most certainly present to make the process of writing the code less complex. Scoring guidelines will always include utilizing past student-created methods and “helper” methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Know how to use column-major order. (Many go into the test having only used row-major order.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very possible that a question will prompt you to access a 2D array by its columns. (We found two in research for this lesson.) If you know you haven't practiced column-major order, give the code below a look. It might be a good idea to create your own code cell with a unique 2D array to practice with."
